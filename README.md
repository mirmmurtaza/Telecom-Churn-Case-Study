# Telecom Churn Case Study

This project focuses on the problem of customer churn in a Telecom company and aims to develop machine learning models to predict churn. The project is implemented in Python using various libraries.

The customer datasets used in this project contain both numerical and categorical features. To further improve the model's performance, the top 30% of customers were identified based on their monthly charges, and dimensionality reduction was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The churn output was formulated using the latest month's usage data, and various machine learning models were developed and evaluated. The best model achieved a recall score of 99.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the techniques used in predicting customer churn in the Telecom industry.
